# Citizen Science
Discoveries, co-discoveries, and possible discoveries related to my activity in the field of [citizen science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science).

I like to keep things simple, and I believe this repository will be useful for me.
The main goal of this project is to keep track of discoveries made by me.

**It's also my way of contributing to the promotion of science** - if you‚Äôre interested in these topics, you'll find links to the mentioned projects here. I hope this can motivate and inspire many people, awakening wonderful passions and interests. ‚≠ê

I dedicate these discoveries to my Family & Friends who support me in every possible way!

Best wishes üöÄ
